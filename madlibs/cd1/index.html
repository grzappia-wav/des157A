        <h2>My Driver's Test</h2>

        <p>Picture this: I have just turned sixteen and a half, and it is my ______(a number)st/nd/th driver's test this week. This time, I am determined to get my license.</p>
        <p>The driver's test was going _______(adverb), that is, until the parallel parking. My instructor, a ________(adjective) woman obnoxiously chewing gum, told me to pull up next to a ________(color) car. I stopped the car, feeling my stress level rise.</p>
        <p>This was it. This was the make-or-break of the test. Slowly, I moved my hand to the gear shift. I took a deep, _______(adjective) breath, and squeezed the shifter. But the stick wouldn’t move? Why wouldn’t it move? After frantically squeezing the stick, trying to move it into reverse, I realized I could not hear my instructor smacking her gum. My laser focus cracked, and I _______(past tense verb) my head to see what was going on with the shifter. Unfortunately, my hand was not on the gear shift. It was on my instructor’s _______(body part).</p>
        <p>_______(feeling) rushed through me like an electric shock. I screamed “I’M SO SORRY” as my ______(body part) shot up in the air, as if to prove my innocence. My instructor, now ______(feeling) said through gritted teeth “... Just… drive.”</p>
        <p>It was over. I failed. My spirit crushed, I completed the parallel park. The rest of the test was silent. I felt like a failure, like _______(person).</p>
        <p>At the end of the test, I apologized again to my instructor, and she left the car. After a(n) ______(length of time), she came back with my score.</p>
        <p>I passed! It was a miracle! That was how I got my driver’s license.</p>
